Also, the data is not rich for all parameters or indicators thus more rich data will give a better prediction. Also, this analysis is done on a very small scale as the knowledge of financial domain is limited to our members so we are not able to cover much but a max of them are in. We are learning a few economic journals to enrich our financial domain understanding and maybe we do some alterations later on while developing projects. Alteration in sense to make project rich not to change project :)."
